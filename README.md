### Course Info

Semester: Spring 2022
## Team Information

## Project Information
*This project seeks to encapsulate the functionality of a real Wordle game. It works by reading in information
from multiple text files and then storing all of the valid words into another text file. Using these valid words, it then chooses one to play
with. The user is then offered multiple chances to guess the word, receiving feedback with each guess.*
## How to run it

*Running the Main.main file should run the entire program from scratch. I used some System.out.printf statements in my Wordle Class
and I am not sure whether that will cause any problems with the running of Gradle. All of the files references in main should be found within the Wordle package folder.
There should be no other issues present.
